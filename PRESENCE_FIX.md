# Presence Feature - Error Fix

## Issue
**Error**: "RoomProvider is missing from the React tree"

## Root Cause
The `PresenceAvatars` component was using Liveblocks suspense hooks (`@liveblocks/react/suspense`) which require being inside a `RoomProvider`. However, the Navbar (where avatars are displayed) is rendered at the layout level, outside the Room context.

## Solution Applied

### Changed Imports
```typescript
// Before (suspense hooks - strict)
import { useOthers, useSelf } from "@liveblocks/react/suspense";

// After (regular hooks - flexible)
import { useOthers, useSelf } from "@liveblocks/react";
```

### Files Updated
1. **`components/presence-avatars.tsx`** - Changed to regular hooks
2. **`components/live-cursors.tsx`** - Changed to regular hooks
3. **`components/cursor-presence.tsx`** - Changed to regular hooks
4. **`app/room.tsx`** - Removed ClientSideSuspense wrapper

### Why This Works
- **Regular hooks** gracefully return `null` or empty arrays when not in a Room
- **Suspense hooks** throw errors when not in a Room (strict requirement)
- **PresenceAvatars** now checks if `others.length === 0` and returns null
- **No errors** when navbar is rendered outside Room context

## Behavior Now

### When NOT in a document (e.g., homepage)
- Navbar renders normally
- PresenceAvatars returns `null` (no avatars shown)
- No errors thrown

### When IN a document (inside Room)
- Navbar renders normally
- PresenceAvatars shows active users
- Live cursors work as expected

## Testing
```bash
# Start dev server
npm run dev

# Navigate to:
1. Homepage - No errors, no avatars (expected)
2. Any document - Avatars appear, cursors work
3. Open same document in 2 windows - See multiple avatars
```

## Technical Details

### Hook Differences
| Feature | Suspense Hooks | Regular Hooks |
|---------|---------------|---------------|
| Error handling | Throws if no Room | Returns null/empty |
| Loading state | Uses Suspense | Immediate render |
| Type safety | Strict | Flexible |
| Use case | Inside Room only | Anywhere |

### Trade-offs
- ✅ **Pro**: No errors, works everywhere
- ✅ **Pro**: Simpler error handling
- ⚠️ **Con**: No loading states (not needed here)
- ⚠️ **Con**: Need manual null checks

## Status
✅ **Fixed** - Error resolved, feature working as expected

The presence feature now works correctly without throwing errors!
